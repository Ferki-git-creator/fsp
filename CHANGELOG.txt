FSP — CHANGELOG  

v1.0 — Original FSP  
- Block-based compression.  
- Pattern search from 2 characters to infinity.  
- Base + DIFF per line.  
- Compressed text could grow larger than original for small patterns (2 chars).  
- Simple line-oriented approach.  

v2.0 — Updated FSP with optimized pattern search  
- Pattern search limited to 3–5 characters to reduce overhead.  
- Automatic minimum pattern length selection (3–5 chars) for maximum repeats.  
- Maximum pattern length extended to 5–6 chars for longer repeated sequences.  
- Base stream stores concatenated unique patterns.  
- References (REF) + literals (LITERAL) replace repeated patterns in text.  
- Patterns that repeat only once are stored as LITERAL to minimize REF overhead.  
- Works on the entire text, not line-by-line.  
- Significantly improved compression ratio; often compresses below original size.  
- Maintains full reversibility: text can be restored exactly.  
- Ideal for repetitive text, logs, versioned files, or sequences with repeated patterns.
