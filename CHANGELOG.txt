FSP — CHANGELOG

v1.0 — Original FSP
- Block-based compression.
- Pattern search from 2 characters to infinity.
- Base + DIFF per line.
- Compressed text could grow larger than original for small patterns (2 chars).
- Simple line-oriented approach.

v2.0 — Updated FSP with optimized pattern search
- Pattern search limited to 3–5 characters to reduce overhead.
- Automatic minimum pattern length selection (3–5 chars) for maximum repeats.
- Maximum pattern length extended to 5–6 chars for longer repeated sequences.
- Base stream stores concatenated unique patterns.
- References (REF) + literals (LITERAL) replace repeated patterns in text.
- Patterns that repeat only once are stored as LITERAL to minimize REF overhead.
- Works on the entire text, not line-by-line.
- Significantly improved compression ratio; often compresses below original size.
- Maintains full reversibility: text can be restored exactly.
- Ideal for repetitive text, logs, versioned files, or sequences with repeated patterns.

v2.1 — Next Level FSP (byte-accurate)
- Byte-exact storage: LITERAL and REF stored as raw bytes, no inflation.
- Automatic pattern length selection refined to 3–5 chars for min and 5–6 for max.
- REF overhead minimized: single-use patterns stored as LITERAL.
- Optimized reference handling for faster compression/decompression.
- Supports long repeated blocks efficiently without increasing complexity.
- Works on any byte stream or file, not just text.
- Compressed data saved directly to file with exact reconstruction possible.
- Speed significantly improved; compression and decompression in milliseconds for small/medium texts.
- Maintains full reversibility; perfect reconstruction guaranteed.
- Ideal for logs, backups, versioned files, text, or any data with repeated patterns.
